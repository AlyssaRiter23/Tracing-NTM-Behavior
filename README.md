# Tracing-NTM-Behavior
We were introduced to non-determinism early in the semester with NFAs (which were
all simply convertible to DFAs), and then PDAs (where in many cases non-determinism
couldnâ€™t be avoided), and then to Nondeterministic Turing Machines (NTMs) where non-
determinism is central to their computational power. In this project I explored such 
automata in detail by building code that emulates NTM execution. I developed a code 
that traces all possible execution paths that a nondeterministic TM (NTM)
might take up until the time when it accepts.
